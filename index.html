&lt;!-- The website is being rewritten. <br>
    The new design will be more responsive, using the bootstrap library. <br>
    All while trying to use as little cookies as possible, zero is the goal. <br>
    I don't really know when it will be finished, though you can check the progress over <a href="https://github.com/Sandaidev/sandaidev.github.io">on Github</a>.<br>
    Cheers. - Sandai --&gt;
